Our GIT FLOW Process
===============================

> git checkout master
> git pull origin master

Before start working, create a feature branch with your name as prefix
> git checkout -b mathewt/<feature_or_bug_name>

Add your files and commit
> git add .
> git commit -m "Your description"

Push your changes to Github
> git push origin mathewt/<feature_or_bug_name>

Go into Github and open Pull Request from your branch to the target branch (in simple cases the "master" branch)

Rinse and repeat.... Note: This is a simple happy path, if your branch is not up-to-date you would need to merge master into your branch prior to you pushing to Github to minimize merging conflicts.... 

In case of needing to merge:

Make sure you are in your current feature branch do the following:
> git fetch origin master:master

> git merge --no-ff master

If there are no conflicts, then push your branch again

> git push origin mathewt/<feature_or_bug_name>

If there are conflicts, you would need to abort the merge and do the following:

> git merge --abort

> git rebase master

Fix all the conflicts one commit at a time. For every commit fix do:

> git add <the_files_you_have_fixed>
> git rebase --continue

Rinse and repeat until all the commits have been rebased, then push your branch to github:

> git push origin mathewt/<feature_or_bug_name>
